# FIXME: optional but recommended if relevant, this is meant to contain the Common Platform Enumeration, which is
# sort of a standard id for applications defined by the NIST. In particular, YunoHost may use this is in the future
# to easily track CVE (=security reports) related to apps. The CPE may be obtained by searching here:
# https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe/search.
# For example, for Nextcloud, the CPE is 'cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud' (no need to include the version number)
